Palabra
=======

Palabra is a crossword editor written in Python. It is free software and
it is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or any later
version.

Requirements
============

- Python 2.4
- PyGTK 2.8

Palabra should work with the above versions of the software packages but they
may need to be refined further (please contact me). In any case,

Palabra is known to work with:

- Python 2.6.4
- GTK+ 2.18.3
- PyGTK 2.16.0

You need the lxml package, called python-lxml in repositories.
It can also be found here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml.

How to install/run
==================

- In the directory of Palabra, run the following command:

  python setup.py build
  
- You can now run Palabra using:

  python palabra
  
- To install Palabra, use:

  sudo python setup.py install
  
However, it may be better to wait until a version of Palabra is available
that is more suitable for daily use. For now, I recommend running Palabra
from the directory itself using the command above.

Getting started
===============

Please see the Palabra manual (needs to be updated):
